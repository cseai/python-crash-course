## Installing Python

We are going to install the latest version of `python 3`.
First, download the python 3 installers from the [python.org](https://www.python.org) website.

I think at the time of my writing the latest version of python 3 is `3.8.5`.
The size of the windows installer is around `25.6 MB`.
I will show you how to install it on windows computer.
Make sure you have already downloaded it.

In this course, we are going to use the **Visual Studio Code** (I prefer to say it **VSCode**) as a Code Editor. It is a very popular code editor.
First, download the VSCode from the given link.

The size of the windows installer is around `54.8 MB`.
